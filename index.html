    <h2 class="italic">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media. </li>
        <li><span class="strike">Css is not necessary</span>&nbsp;<span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li><span class="under">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="italic">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elemenr in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.However, <span class="bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element
        and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is a wide rage of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
